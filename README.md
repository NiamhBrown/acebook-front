## About the Project

**Acebook** is a full-stack social networking application that allows users to connect with friends, share posts, and interact through likes and comments. The initial set-up of this application (MERN stack) was provided by Makers and then built upon as a group project during the bootcamp (original project [here](https://github.com/NiamhBrown/acebook-mern-project)). I have since deployed the application using [Render](https://render.com/), and have continued to improve the project with additional features and functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT tokens.
- **Password security**: Password salting and hashing using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).
- **Friend Management**: Search, send, and accept/deny friend requests.
- **Post Creation**: Create and publish posts to the feed page.
- **Interactive Features**: Like and comment on posts.
- **Edit user profile**: Update your user information.
